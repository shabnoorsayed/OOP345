In this workshop we had to create copy constructor and copy assignment along with the move construction and move assignment operator 
which gave me a brief idea about how things actually work for move semantics which makes it more efficent and fast in comparision to the other. 
In move we change the addresses rather then the values, move semnatics move the ownership from one objects to another,
we can also localize as move constructor can call move assignment operator as they work on similar logic.
I also got a deeper understanding of rvalue and lvalue as during the last weeks quiz i messed that up, but now i have 
understood that rvalue is a temporary value and lvalue which is also the current value is the values whose address we take.
our move operator makes a shallow copy of the reference object to current objectand then delete the refernce object.

In this workshop we also use steady_clock::time_point which we can use like stopwatch to calculate the time a event took.

i struggled the most during submission as at first i had problems in opening .bashrc file which i asked you about and the other part was with my code as at first i had 
invaild size error on my msg string and later i realized my stupid mistake that i was assigning my strings to nullptr which was wrong and also i had problems with my 
copy constructor at first as it was not copy the values correctly as i was not correctly assinging values to my string properly o i changed that too.
