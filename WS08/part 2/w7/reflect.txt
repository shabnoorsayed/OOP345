The advantage of using smart pointers is that we didn't had to worry about memory leaks and 
deleting our object like we had in raw pointers, although for some reason i still had memory leaks 
in the raw pointer function but i asked my friends and they told me that it happened with them too.

The major difference between smart and raw pointer is basically the deallocation of memoery that 
happens automatically in smart pointer therefore no memory leaks possible on the other hand in 
raw pointer we ourseleves have to deallocate or it would throw exception or leaks.

raw pointer example from code where we delete our object
if (desc[i].code == price[j].code) {
	Product* temp(new Product(desc[i].desc, price[j].price));
	temp->validate();
	priceList += temp;
	delete temp;
}
